#**Hub3c.com**#
## A static HTML website that hopefully could serve as a working prototype for the new Hub3c.com marketing website. ##

###Wait, what? Why the heck would you add even more work to yourself which __has caused even more delay__ in your delivery time, Ben?###

Let's just face it, to come up with a flat & static prototype such as sketch or psd for either web apps or sites is just not gonna work these days. It's not agile, not practical for both developers & designers. 

On the other hand, due to its 'static' nature, creating a working prototype with good ol' HTML, CSS and JS is just way too painful and hard to manage. Too much copy-paste situation everywhere and before we know we don't know anymore which one is what. 

For example imagine a multiple-page web app with an admin page with sidebar links that are suppose to show how this would work. To create that, one will need to repeatedly copy-paste the `<head>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`. The worst part will be - updating manually the menu each time. Then what about the link to stylesheet and JS? There you go. 

##**Ok. Could you please stop showing off and complaining about your life and actually do something about it?**##

__Let's make the static **dynamic**!__ 

##**And how would you do such thing?**##

1. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. [bower](https://bower.io/)
3. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
4. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

Plus other packages.

##**If anyone should be interested to see what I was on about, please do the following**##

1. git clone this repo - `git clone git@bitbucket.org:benworkandplay/hub3c.com.git && cd hub3c.com`
3. `npm install`
4. `bower install`
5. `gulp serve`

### Whoa...  Sorry, I don't need all these. I just need your html, css and js to get me started. ###

Sure, in fact at the end of the day, that's the purpose of all these - _to provide everyone with a working solution_. You can find the compiled **_dist** folder. This is the compiled files. Beware though, you might get unexpected results. 

##**Thanks everyone!**##
