A static HTML website that hopefully could serve as Hub3c.com marketing website.

## So why would add even more work? ##
Let's just face it, to come up with a flat & static prototype such as sketch or psd for either web apps or sites is just not gonna work these days. It's not agile, not practical for both developers & designers. 

On the other hand, due to its 'static' nature, creating a working prototype with good ol' HTML, CSS and JS is just way too painful and hard to manage. Too much copy-paste situation everywhere and before we know we don't know anymore which one is what. 

For example imagine a multiple-page web app with an admin page with sidebar links that are suppose to show how this would work. To create that, one will need to repeatedly copy-paste the `<head>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`. The worst part will be - updating manually the menu each time. Then what about the link to stylesheet and JS? There you go.
